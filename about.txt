# macropad/numpad
## macropad/numpad with screen and rotary knob capability
##### this board is a simple numpad made in kicad that will help me type numbers quickly on the computer as well as assign macro hotkeys and such.
I have wanted a macropad for a while so I think this is a great idea. 

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost? What's your timeline?

This project will likely cost about 50 dollars, switches will take up most of the budget as well as the pcb, hot swap sockets, flux, sauter, lcd screen, and rotary knob.
I plan to get this project done in about a week after it arrives, making the pcb was the main challenging part and I do not predict soldering or putting together the final product
to take that long, except maybe the 3d printing.

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***

I honestly didnt know where to start, I looked all around youtube and github and eventually came up with my own design after many
issues of trial and error. At first I started on easyEDA but quickly realized it was not a very popular software for the project I
was planning to do, which is what prompted me to switch to Kicad. Aside from that, I needed to think about every aspect as well as
the main fact that I wanted to include a knob for video editing or song volume, as well as a full numpad. One source that majorly helped me out
was the hackclub keypad course: https://hackpad.hackclub.com/ Overall this project was something new for me and i'm glad I was able to 
finish it.
